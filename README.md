- **Databases**: Create and manage databases with support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, and Redis.
- **Backups**: Automate backups for databases to an external storage destination.
- **Docker Compose**: Native support for Docker Compose to manage complex applications.
- **Multi Node**: Scale applications to multiple nodes using Docker Swarm to manage the cluster.
- **Templates**: Deploy open-source templates (Plausible, Pocketbase, Calcom, etc.) with a single click.
- **Traefik Integration**: Automatically integrates with Traefik for routing and load balancing.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor CPU, memory, storage, and network usage for every resource.

- **Multi Server**: Deploy and manage your applications remotely to external servers.
- **Self-Hosted**: Self-host Dokploy on your VPS.
- **MCP Inspector**: Built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) inspector to test and debug MCP servers. Open **MCP Inspector** from the dashboard sidebar to connect to MCP servers via stdio, SSE, or streamable HTTP.

### MCP Inspector (development)

The dashboard includes an **MCP Inspector** at **Dashboard → MCP Inspector**. It is built from the `apps/inspector-client` app and served at `/inspector/`.

- **Build the Inspector UI** (so it appears at `/inspector/`):  
  `pnpm run inspector:build`
- **Run the Inspector proxy** (needed for stdio / local MCP connections):  
  `pnpm run inspector-server:dev`  
  The proxy runs on port 6277; the Inspector UI in the dashboard will use it when connecting to local/stdio MCP servers.
